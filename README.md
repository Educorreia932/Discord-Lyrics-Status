# Discord Lyrics Status

This is a simple Python script that changes one's Discord status to a random lyrics excerpt and a random emoji (for the moment only, I intend to generate an emoji given the lyrics meaning).

The motivation for this sript resides in a friend of mine joking I had to make a bot to automate the processing of setting my Discord status as some lyric, since it was a common habit of mine.

**Note:** Automating an user's profile goes against Discord's Terms of Service, with the risk of having your account banned, so, be careful if you are to use this script.
